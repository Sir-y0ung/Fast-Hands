----------------------------
It's the year 2244. Time to leave the planet.
Eighty years ago, Earth faced a crisis like never before. Fossil fuels had been exhausted, water was scarce, and power a luxury. In a world filled with darkness, tensions began to rise between nations, and the once united global community split into two power states, each vying for control, power, and survival. These 80 years of dispute stayed in history as the Dark War.

Now, 16 years after the Armistice, warface is about to re-emerge. Scientists have confirmed an alternative power source on Mars – Vitalium – and the two states are now racing to establish a colony on the red planet. A ruthless competition of hacking and cyber-attacks has begun, and both sides are trying to damage and exploit each other's infrastructure.

You're part of the United Nations of Zenium, and your state wants to create a democratic colony where Vitalium will be used to make humanity healthy again. Your opponent is the Board of Arodor, a strict dictatorship that wants to ensure only the elite can get a second chance in life.

Win and escape the planet or fail to survive.
